# Security Policy

## Authentication System Security

The authentication system in this application handles sensitive user data and access control. We take security seriously and appreciate any efforts to responsibly disclose potential vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email us at security@example.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

## Scope

The following components are in scope for security reports:

- Authentication flows
- Session management
- Password handling
- Role-based access control
- Profile management
- Database security
- API endpoints related to auth
- Environment configuration

## Security Expectations

Our authentication system is designed to:

- Use secure password hashing
- Implement proper session management
- Enforce role-based access control
- Protect against common vulnerabilities
- Follow security best practices
- Maintain user privacy

## Common Vulnerabilities

Please check for these common security issues:

1. Authentication Bypass

   - Session fixation
   - Token manipulation
   - Cookie security

2. Access Control

   - Privilege escalation
   - Role manipulation
   - Unauthorized access

3. Data Protection

   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Insecure storage
   - Unencrypted transmission

4. Input Validation
   - SQL injection
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - CSRF attacks

## Response Timeline

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- Provide initial assessment within 72 hours
- Fix critical issues within 7 days
- Keep you updated on progress

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure and will not take legal action if:

- You notify us promptly
- Avoid privacy violations
- Don't exploit vulnerabilities
- Give us reasonable time to respond

## Environment Setup for Security Testing

1. Create a test environment:

```bash
npm run setup-test-env
```

2. Configure security settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add security-specific settings
```

3. Run security checks:

```bash
npm run auth:verify
```

## Security Headers

Our authentication system enforces these security headers:

```typescript
{
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'",
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block'
}
```

## Security Measures

1. **Password Requirements**

   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Complexity requirements
   - Secure hashing (Argon2)

2. **Session Security**

   - Secure cookie flags
   - CSRF protection
   - Session timeout

3. **Rate Limiting**

   - Login attempts
   - Password resets
   - API calls

4. **Data Protection**
   - Data encryption
   - Secure communication
   - Proper data handling
