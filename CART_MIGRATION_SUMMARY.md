# Cart Migration: Dashboard → Marketing Pages

## Summary

Successfully moved the cart functionality from dashboard pages to marketing pages, allowing guest users (non-signed-in users) to add items to cart before signing up or logging in.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Cart from Dashboard**
- **DashboardShell.tsx**: Removed cart imports and CartSheet integration
- **Header.tsx**: Removed CartIcon import and usage, updated navigation icons

### 2. **Added Cart to Marketing Pages**
- **Navigation.tsx**: Added cart functionality via ClientNavigation component
- **ClientNavigation.tsx**: New component to handle client-side cart state
- **MarketingCartProvider.tsx**: New provider for global cart state management
- **Marketing Layout**: Wrapped with MarketingCartProvider for cart access

### 3. **Component Architecture**
```
Marketing Layout
├── MarketingCartProvider (cart state + CartSheet)
    ├── Navigation (server component)
        └── ClientNavigation (client component with CartIcon)
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### **For Guest Users (Marketing Pages):**
- ✅ Can browse products on marketing pages
- ✅ Can add items to cart before signing in
- ✅ Cart icon appears in navigation when items are added
- ✅ Can view cart contents and manage items
- ✅ Cart persists across page navigation

### **For Signed-in Users (Dashboard):**
- ✅ Clean dashboard experience without cart distraction
- ✅ Focus on administrative/management tasks
- ✅ Cart available when visiting marketing pages

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### **Client/Server Component Split:**
- **Navigation**: Server component (fetches user data)
- **ClientNavigation**: Client component (handles cart state)
- **MarketingCartProvider**: Client component (global cart management)

### **State Management:**
- **Cart Store**: `useMarketingCartStore` (existing Zustand store)
- **UI Store**: `useUIStore` (cart open/close state)
- **Persistence**: Cart items persist in localStorage across sessions

### **Performance Optimization:**
- Cart only loads on marketing pages where needed
- Dashboard remains lightweight without cart overhead
- Lazy loading of cart components

- `components/DashboardShell.tsx` - Removed cart integration

### **Created:**
