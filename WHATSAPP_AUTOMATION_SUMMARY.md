# WhatsApp Automation Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Automatic Order Confirmation Messages to Admin**

**What it does:** When any order is confirmed (both guest and authenticated users), an automatic WhatsApp message is sent to the admin with order details.

**Where implemented:**
- `/app/actions/purchaseActions.ts` - Added automatic notifications in both `handlePurchaseOrder` and `handleGuestOrder` functions
- Uses `sendAdminWhatsAppNotification` from `/lib/whatsapp/notifications.ts`

**Message format:**
```

```
