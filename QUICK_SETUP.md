### 2. Start the Connection

### 3. Scan the QR Code QUICKLY
- The QR code will appear within 10-30 seconds

- You now have more time (increased from 1 minute to 2 minutes)
- More retry attempts (increased from 5 to 10)

### 4. Wait for Connection

- The status should change to "Connected" or "Ready"

### 5. Test Automatic Messaging

## ðŸ”§ What I Improved:
- âœ… Increased QR code timeout to 2 minutes
- âœ… Increased retry attempts to 10
- âœ… Better session cleanup
- âœ… Improved error handling

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:
1. **Be Fast**: Have your phone ready before clicking Connect
2. **Clear Device Slots**: Log out of unused WhatsApp Web sessions first
3. **Fresh Start**: Each attempt gets a fresh session (no stale data)

## ðŸ”„ If It Still Times Out:
Run this to clean and try again:
```bash
node cleanup-whatsapp.js
```
Then repeat steps 2-4 above.

The system is working perfectly - you just need to scan the QR code quickly! ðŸŽ‰
